This folder contains the following Python scripts:
    1] train.py
    2] test.py

------------------------------Instructions---------------------------------
** The test and train data files should be copied to the project folder **
** The test and train data should be a .npy file.


------------------------------ train.py -----------------------------------
** This trains the convolutonal neural network. 

The following commands can be used to run the program:
      
   1)    python train.py x_train_clean.npy y_train_clean.npy
            
            This command creates the CNN model and saves it on the disk.
            The input data present in the file "x_train_clean.npy" "y_train_clean.npy" is already pre processed and cleaned.
            This would not pre process the input data. 
            *DO NOT USE THIS IF YOU WISH TO NOT JUST CREATE THE MODEL FROM OUR ALREADY PREPROCESSED DATASET.*
            ALSO, WE WERE NOT ABLE TO UPLOAD "x_train_clean.npy" TO GIT
            Please download from google drive - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Z4I8j4hxsG7hfzsJknaZEuUhtnVLSN23/view?usp=sharing
   
   2)    python train.py 
            
            This command creates the CNN model and saves it on the disk.
            
			The input data is loaded from MNIST dataset and the data file named "X_train.npy" and "y_train.npy"
            
			"X_train.npy" - We were not able to upload the file to GIT, so download from google drive
			https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YhjpqalLnxMooaU3f6J4glqaGsBdpb_R/view?usp=sharing
			"y_train.npy" - Is the training data given in the in the same directory.
         
			These files should be present in the same directory as the program with the name "X_train.npy" and "y_train.npy"
            If you wish to train the model with your own data file then either
               a. Replace your data files with the same name as "X_train.npy" and "y_train.npy"
               b. Change the file names on the line 285 with your data and label file names
                  line 285 : x_train, y_train = preProcessData(<YOUR DATA FILE NAME>,<YOUR LABEL FILE NAME>)


-------------------------- Trained Models --------------------------------
** The trained models can be found by the file name "model.json" and its values as "model.hs"


------------------------------ test.py -----------------------------------
** This loads the trained model and tests on a test data set.
** The trained model files "model.json" and "model.hs" should be present in the same directory as the program is.
** Steps to execute
            1] Import the python file and its predict method defined as below

                     from test import predict

            2] Execute the predict method and store the predicted labels in a variable.
               This method takes in the test data fileName. 
               The file with the same name should be present in the same directory as the program is.

                     predicted_values = predict('test_data_marker.npy') 

** It will return the predicted values.
